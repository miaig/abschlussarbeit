## Docs

This Program aims to receive Data from a dynamic amount of Sensors and Display the data on the Webserver. This can be done using the example Sensors in the sensor folder or by just writing your own ones using the further down documented Json file. The server and port get defined in sensors/sender.py. That file can be imported as shown in the examples.

The Webserver distiguishes between two update formats: live and history.
The data needs to be providet in the following format to be considered a history update. To be considered a live update the fielts type and unit have to be removed from the transmission.

  ```Json
      {
      "location": "Building A - Lab 3",
      "sensors": [
        {
          "id": "sensor_001",
          "type": "temperature",
          "unit": "Â°C",
          "readings": [
            { "ts": 1747814400, "value": 22.5 },
            { "ts": 1747818000, "value": 23.0 },
            { "ts": 1747821600, "value": 23.7 }
          ]
        },
        {
          "id": "sensor_002",
          "type": "humidity",
          "unit": "%",
          "readings": [
            { "ts": 1747814400, "value": 45.2 },
            { "ts": 1747818000, "value": 47.1 },
            { "ts": 1747821600, "value": 46.8 }
          ]
        },
        {
          "id": "sensor_003",
          "type": "pressure",
          "unit": "hPa",
          "readings": [
            { "ts": 1747814400, "value": 1012.4 },
            { "ts": 1747818000, "value": 1012.8 },
            { "ts": 1747821600, "value": 1013.0 }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ```

- `shell.nix`
  This file is only used for the nix packagemananger to set up a development environment for the Webserver only
- `.envrc`
  This is also a bit of linux nixos magic to automatically set up the development environment using direnv
- `main.py`
  This file starts all sensors at once for easy deployment at a site.

## Instalation

### Sensors
To Install the exmple Sensors, simply install all the Requiered packages mentioned further above
